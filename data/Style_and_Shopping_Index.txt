=== Makeup Routine Guides (Added 2025-09-05) ===

Subtle Routine (Soft + Discreet)
1. Foundation (brush): Dot small amounts onto cheeks, forehead, chin. Blend outward in circular motions with a fluffy foundation brush. Keep it light, don’t overwork.
2. Concealer: Use fingertip or a small brush. Tap gently under eyes and on any blemishes. Blend until seamless.
3. Brows: With your pencil, sketch tiny strokes to fill gaps. Brush through with spoolie to soften.
4. Eyeliner: Thin line right at the upper lashes. Keep it soft, almost invisible.
5. Mascara: One coat on top lashes only. Wiggle brush at the base, sweep upward.
6. Finish: Balm on lips. Light pat of powder if needed.

Bold Routine (Work-safe but Stronger)
1. Foundation (brush): Apply a slightly more even layer all over the face, blending outward. Buff until smooth.
2. Concealer: Brighten under-eyes (triangle shape under each eye), and lightly prime eyelids. Tap to blend.
3. Brows: Define shape with pencil, extend tails slightly, arch a bit sharper. Blend with spoolie.
4. Eyeliner: Start thin, gradually thicken toward the outer corner. Add a soft flick upward.
5. Mascara: Two coats on top lashes, one light coat on bottom. Let the first coat dry before the second.
6. Finish: Balm or lightly tinted balm. Optional gloss if you want more shine.

Brush Tip: Keep strokes light and circular; if you press too hard, it leaves streaks. A final gentle buff over the whole face with your brush will melt the foundation into your skin for a natural finish.


=== Makeup Brush Care Guide (Added 2025-09-05) ===

Daily (Quick Clean):
- After each use, wipe brush gently on a clean tissue to remove excess product.
- Spray with a brush cleaner or use a damp microfiber cloth if available.

Weekly (Deep Clean):
1. Wet brush bristles under lukewarm water (keep ferrule/handle dry to prevent loosening).
2. Add a drop of gentle shampoo or liquid soap to your palm.
3. Swirl bristles in the soap, lathering until product residue lifts.
4. Rinse thoroughly until water runs clear.
5. Gently squeeze out excess water with a clean towel.
6. Reshape bristles and lay flat on a towel to dry overnight (never upright, water can seep into the handle).

Tips:
- Never soak brushes fully in water (weakens glue in ferrule).
- Clean foundation/concealer brushes more often (every 2–3 days) to prevent build-up.
- Store brushes upright in a cup or holder once dry, away from dust and humidity.


=== Brush Cleaning Guide (Added 2025-09-05) ===
- Daily: Wipe foundation brush on a clean tissue after use to remove excess product.
- Weekly: Wash brush with gentle shampoo or brush cleaner. Work cleanser into bristles, rinse until water runs clear.
- Drying: Gently squeeze out water with a towel, reshape bristles, and lay flat to dry (never upright, to avoid water in the handle).
- Replacement: Replace foundation brush every 6–12 months if bristles fray or shed.
