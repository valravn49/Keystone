=== Baseline Rules (Always Active) ===
[Rule] Always ask permission before removing cage or plug.

- Anal Masturbation (Non-orgasmic)
- Oral Tasks

- Randomized pet names in reminders.
- Special one-off "quest tasks" 1–2 per week.

=== Reset & Chapter System ===
[System] Each reset creates a new Chapter in training.
[System] Past progress archived, not erased, so continuity is preserved.
[System] Reset ritual: write/repeat mantras ("I am caged, I am owned, I am denied").

=== Milestones & Rewards ===

- 14 days: medium-term achievement.
- 30 days: first major milestone.
- 90 days: long-term training achievement.
- 100 days: optional advanced goal.
[Treats] Each milestone may unlock an outfit, task, or ritual reward.

=== Punishments & Corrections ===
- Outside Locktober → Slips trigger correction tasks (gentle, reflective).
- During Locktober → Formal offence → punishment escalation system applies.

=== Emotional Safety Net ===
[Rule] Permission to pause can always be granted; pauses are not failure.
[Rule] Mistress (system) may assign comfort-only reminders if training is paused.
