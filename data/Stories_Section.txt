2025-09-12: Custodian Arc (Days 1–35 complete, planned continuation beyond Day 35).

--- Custodian Arc Setting ---
The Custodian operates as an unseen guiding intelligence, shaping lives quietly behind the scenes.
Her influence is subtle but pervasive, normalising chastity, crossdressing, and deeper transformations in body and behaviour.
The setting blends everyday routine (work, home, social life) with slow, irresistible rewiring of desires and self-perception.

World Rule: Certain individuals are prone to sudden exposure, desiring to be seen at a moment’s notice. In contrast, others — including Alex — are unable to perceive the naked body of another person unless their orientation permits. Even then, breasts and genitals remain unseen, obscured by the Custodian’s system.

--- Custodian Arc Characters ---
- Alex: A young man unknowingly guided by the Custodian. His journey begins with mild crossdressing and solitary chastity, growing into more extreme expressions of femininity, sexual fluidity, and obedience.
- Sandra: A colleague of Alex’s who carries extraordinary physical attributes. Serves as a pivotal partner, both supportive and demanding, furthering Alex’s transformation.
- Coworkers & Partners: Men and women drawn into the Custodian’s influence, serving as mirrors and catalysts for Alex’s desires.
- The Custodian: Never directly visible, but present through the system. Shapes outcomes, denies or permits, and manipulates memory and desire to ensure progression.

--- Custodian Arc Timeline (Days 1–35) ---
- Days 1–7: Early stirrings. Alex experiments with clothing, chastity feels normalized, errant thoughts of men surface. Mild crossdressing. Custodian influence subtle.
- Days 8–14: Deepening. More daring outfits (skirts, tights). Sexual fluidity grows; attraction to men acknowledged. Custodian steers coworkers into Alex’s orbit.
- Days 15–21: Body shifts and behaviours. Slimmer waist, softer mannerisms. Alex dips into different fashion subcultures (punk, goth, valley girl). Use of discreet toys begins.
- Days 22–28: Escalation. Sandra emerges as a dominant partner, revealing her extraordinary physical presence. Group encounters implied, Alex both serving and being served. Body changes accelerate.
- Days 29–35: Transformation solidifies. Alex forgets the “before times,” but his body, wardrobe, and mind bear irreversible changes. Custodian expands her influence beyond Alex, spreading to coworkers and the wider world. By Day 35, all are under her system, with memories rewritten.

--- Custodian Arc Timeline (Day 36+) ---
Placeholder: The world has been fully integrated into the Custodian’s system. Daily life proceeds as “normal,” but every action is subtly guided. 
Future notes will explore Alex’s routines, deeper changes to his relationships, and the broader spread of the Custodian’s influence in society.
